# Introduction

[Edit this page](https://github.com/NUMSC-CoreFacility/sharedLabSpace/edit/gh-pages/plate-reader.md)

## Purposes: 
1) Can be used for multiple types of large scale DNA quantification including, a fluorometric based approach using a picoGreen assay (reagents needed) or an absorbance based approach with the Take3 insert (similar to a nanodrop; no reagents needed).

## Location: Shared Molecular Lab

## Protocols: 

* [Picogreen dsDNA Assay Quantification Assay Protocol](https://numsc-corefacility.github.io/sharedLabSpace/picoGreenAssaydsDNA.md) This protocol is for performing the equivalent of "qubit" (fluorometric) on a whole plate. It's always good to cross-check a few of these outputs against quibit measures.

## Reagents and Supplies: 

* PicoGreen Kits - [Link](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/quant-it-picogreen-dsdna/p7589) - Sold by multiple vendors.
